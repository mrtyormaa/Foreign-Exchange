# Foreign-Exchange

Threre are a few known bugs in this code which will be fixed.

Few junk files have been uploaded. I have not removed those cause of time constraints.

# File Structure and known bugs - 
The main mfile inside source is the starting point of execution.
- update the variable 'testDir' to run the code. (Be careful. This code runs iteratively to search for csv files inside the selected variable 'testDir')
- the min, max, mean functions have not yet been implemented and have pseudo code. [known bug. will be fixed within next 5 hours]
- if you try to run the program twice, it will fail. as it creates the output files in the same folder as input. [known bug. will be fixed in next release]
- directionality is not calculated properly for a few cases. [known bug. will be fixed in next 5 hours]
- Only 'Minute' time interval has been implemented in this release. Rest will be updated within next 2-3 days.
